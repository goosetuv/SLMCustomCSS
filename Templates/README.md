# Templates

The default version of this `custom.css` repo is [#goffsnow](/Images/goffsnow.png).  Just to show what is possible with this, I have created a few templates with quite possibly the worst colour schemes in the world.

Although these are templates they do work the same way as the 'default' one, but they might not have the most recent fixes straight away so I would recommend only using them to see what is possible and what changing the `:root { }` colour looks like.

## Contributing
Happy for anyone to contribute new templates, take a fork and push through some requests.
